This text file is mainly made to keep track of errors encountered during the making of this homework, or
any sort of nuances when it comes to typing code in C++. This file, among other series of future files is
mainly to and to get a better understading of the C++ programming language.

1. If a function template is going to be used, apparently all of the types must be used that are defined
   in it. Example:

	template <typename T, typename U>
	void funct(T); //This will throw an error.

2. srand is epic and awesome

3. The value passed into srand() is 1 by default, but (I think) if you are calling a function that uses
   rand() inside the main function, you are (sort of?) seeding the rand function on the spot.

4. Template functions are ALWAYS defined AND declared in the header file.
