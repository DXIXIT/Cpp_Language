/*
In the header files above you can see that we have created a data structure known as a stack.
A stack is a lot like a stack of books in real life, you can only remove the item that was
placed last. A stack is a type of "list" where the last item in the list is also the first to
be removed.

We're going to use a template class in conjunction with the stack data structure.
