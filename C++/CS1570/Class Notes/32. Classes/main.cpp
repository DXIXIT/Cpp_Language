/*
Today we will now talk about OOP (the sound you make when you stub your toe)

- The goal of OOP is to make C++ more applicable to a wide range of problems.
- Stucts are used more often in C, and classes are used more often in C++
- We will be creating our own types.

New things for classe:
- Private and public variables and functions
- constructors

Private object variables cannot be accessed/modified outside the function. They are hidden.
Private object methods are also hidden.
Private objects are only accessible inside the class.

Object Oriented Programming achieves much better data encapsulation.
- This means that a user knows how to use an object but doesn't know how
  it is internally implemented.

Go to the header file shown below to see an example of a class

#include "Fraction.h"

using namespace std;

int main(void)
{
	cout << "Hello World!\n";
	return 0;
}
