/*
Algorithms need to be:
	1. Feasable
	2. Correct

Though correctness is valued more for beginners.

- A problem needs to be understood *properly* before it is solved.
- A problem needs to be simplified if possible.
- Solutions need to be brainstromed via a psuedocode or some other
	way. This proposed solution can be analysed and its quality can then be checked.
- Quality of a code is checked, again, based on the two criterion    above.
- The code is then implemented.
- Following these steps can reduce debugging time (sometimes by 24   hours).
- Debugging (testing) and coding should be done at the same time.
